  "transcript": "11431 Seagrass Circle. Estimate. Hello sir, how are you? Hi, how are you? Good morning. Alright, thank you. Oh, sorry, sorry. Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you, sir. Lewis. Lewis, hi Lewis. Morrow. Nice to meet you. Okay, so we can start in this room. Sure. I had a leak in January and I put a new roof on since then. Okay. So I wanted to fix that and just double check around the moldings at the bottom if they're okay. Because unfortunately I can't see anymore. Okay. Yeah, I see some discoloration there. Underneath the shelf? Yeah. Yeah. So this happened in January last year. And then I had this, had the new roof put on in March. Okay. Actually, well I found it in April. Okay. That's this room, right? Yep. And I'll just fill up this study for a minute. Right in here. Mm hmm. There's a bifold closet on the left. Okay. You know, I don't know if the house settled or the closet, they put so much stuffing under when they did it, but I guess I just needed maybe a new door. Yeah, that's what it looks like. It looks, it looks like. I mean, they're in decent shape. It's 28 years old. Yeah, it looks like the door is actually cracking and separating. It is. On itself. So yeah, it's. I mean, I know last time I tried the, the pop-up that goes into the track. Yeah. That cracked. That's what it looks like. The wood is just separating. Yeah. Just, it's just too old. Yeah, so I'd want to change that door. All right. Let's see. 36. 36 inches wide bifold door. 36 by 80. Okay. Okay. I got that. Here you have doors. Okay. There's a third down further on the left. It's for the laundry closet. These are doing the same thing. Looking to replace them. Yeah. I just want, I can't take the mirrored doors anymore. Okay. Okay. I don't know if you still like mirrors anyway, as you can see. Yeah. Okay. This one's 24 inches wide. Another 24 by 80. This one. 60 inches wide. Okay. So that's going to be two 30 inch doors. That's right. Cause the door on the right, you can see the way I, you always have to keep it. The right hand corner all the way up. Okay. Notice that. I can see, it looks like it's definitely sagging in the middle. Yeah. That's probably because these are older, heavy metal frames, you know? So the stuff we put in would be a lot lighter. You know, I'm just looking for something functional, you know, functional, something white. White. You know? Yeah. Okay. Flat. Flat white. Okay. Flat white. Yeah. I think I'm going by memory. It looks pretty beige. Yeah. I'll say these are, this is, I think a flat white is perfect here. Cause. I think so. To me, it looks beige or whitish. You're. Yeah. The paint. Yeah. So. Yeah. So flat white should work fine. Yeah. This last door is 36 inches wide. By 80. Now, those vented or are they solid? These are all solid. I mean. Yeah. I mean. Yeah, laundry room is okay. Exactly. That's probably where you would use it the most. Yeah. Laundry rooms. Yeah. I like that. They're still working. The hallway just further down. Yeah, as long as I work and, you know. Yeah. Now I have another question for you. Do you do painting? Yes, sir. I mean, pretty much everything, anything you need here. Really? Yeah. What's coming up? Hello. Hello. Hello. Only by mistake. Hmm? 848 AM. One notification. Phone. Now. Go ahead. This call. Phone. Now. Go clear. Yeah, only by mistake. By mistake. Letting you know I'm here? Yeah. Maybe. I called you, eh? Oh, yeah. Okay. Anyway. TV is on the wall there. Yeah. It's broke. I got here. And it gave me a lot of trouble anyway. So I have a new TV. That's what was on the floor when you were looking in the dining room. This box is there. Yeah. There's a new bracket and a new TV. Okay. That happens to be a 50-inch, which is really a little too big for here. Okay. But I got a swivel bracket. Yeah. All right. Okay. And you could move. If you had to, you could go to a level toward the mirror. Yeah. And it's only, I think, an inch, inch and a half bigger than this one. Okay. So I'm looking to put the new bracket on and mount the new TV. Okay. Is that something you're bothered with? Yeah. We can do that too. You can? Yeah. Okay. All right. What's your timing on something like the TV? Everything I would just have to double-check with my wife. She does all the scheduling and the billing and all that. Okay. My wife used to do it. Yeah? Yeah. When I started my business 35, 36 years ago, we worked out of the house. That's what we did. Yeah. That's how we do it. Yeah. And it's great for me because it's like it frees up a whole different brainpower. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. So, yeah, I focus on the fixing. She focuses on the business. That's the best thing. Yeah. Yeah. My wife was good at it. Yeah. It was great. And I think yours is too. Yeah. She's on it. She's definitely on it. So I guess what you could do, the painting, I mean, eventually, I've got to really do a lot of painting here. Okay. But I do want to get the dining room at least. Yeah. We could take care of those stains. Yeah. Yeah. It's on the bottom. I didn't really see anything else. So. Did you up on top? Did you? I saw some like a little separation. Yeah. That's where the water leak was. The top in the corner up there. Yeah. I'll go through it and double check again. Okay. But to me, it just looks great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, but to me, it just looks like we got a prime, a little caulking, and some paint, and you'll be all good over there. You know, this is because this house has the original paint job. Oh. So, whoops, correction. You'd do better to have the stick. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I know I've never used it in the house. I'm using it for show here. I'm not talking to you. Yeah. Yeah. See, the first thing I was thinking of doing, and I guess you'll have to give me prices for everything that you looked at today, and then we can go from there, but this whole main area, living room, dining room, hallway, has one paint job. Does that make sense or not? Yeah. We can... Or should we do it in smaller sections? I don't know. Well... I think you cut off the dining room somewhere. I'm not sure where it is or isn't. Yeah. Yeah. You could do... Exactly. Maybe this section would be separate, and then you could do that one separately, or however you want to do it, you know? Yeah. We just... Because probably it'll get done when I'm not here. Yeah. My neighbor, my good friend across the street, Rosa, she has a key. Oh, okay. I'll make it easier. I won't be in the way. Yeah. That works. We could... Yeah. We could set it up and do it however you want, you know? Yeah. But the most important thing is getting the TV... Yeah. That's what I'll do for you. I'll give you the prices and all the stuff for the little things you just showed me. Yeah. Timing. Yeah. Timing will set you... Unfortunately, the TV, if we can't do that soon, which is not a big deal, because that's the only thing I have in my bedroom, I might have to see if I can get somebody else to do it quicker. But, you know, it's not a big deal. Yeah. No worries. I'm sure I can get to it relatively soon. Okay. You know? So figure it out. Give me a price for things. Perfect. And call me back and price and timing. Sounds good, sir. Okay. All right. Thank you. All right. Good to talk to you. Good to talk to you. You should hear from us soon. Thank you. Thank you. Talk to you soon, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ",
